Local patches to edfpack Sources
================================
This directory tracks the patches applied to the vanilla edfpack-sources
otherwise provided. As cmake-2.8.0 does not yet provide easy means to
apply patches at the users side, patches are applied directly to the
repository.

The remainder of this README describes the patches in some detail.
