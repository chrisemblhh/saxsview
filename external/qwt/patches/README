Local patches to Qwt Sources
============================
This directory tracks the patches applied to the vanilla qwt-sources otherwise
provided. As cmake-2.8.0 does not yet provide easy means to apply patches at
the users side, patches are applied directly to the repository.

The remainder of this README describes the patches in some detail.

user.
