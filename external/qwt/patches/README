Local patches to Qwt Sources
============================
This directory tracks the patches applied to the vanilla qwt-sources otherwise
provided. As cmake-2.8.0 does not yet provide easy means to apply patches at
the users side, patches are applied directly to the repository.

The remainder of this README describes the patches in some detail.



001-legend-item-size.patch
--------------------------
Superseeded by import of qwt/trunk r1238.


002-external-legend-position.patch
----------------------------------
Superseeded by import of qwt/trunk r1238.


003-legend-item-testattribute.patch
-----------------------------------
The QwtPlotLegendItem does not check if an item requested not to be 
included in the legend via "setItemAttribute(QwtPlotItem::Legend, false)".

This patch breaks compability with the QwtLegend, but as we are not
interested in that any more, so what. It simplifies the client code
significantly.


004-set-colorbar-interval.patch
-------------------------------
The API of QwtScaleWidget::setColorMap/colorMap was changed that the former 
only accepts non-const pointers while the latter only returns const pointers. 
Here it's useful to change the z-interval to mask out point below or above
a threshold. For this I used to use setColorMap(newRange, colorMap()), which
is now broken (r1298). One could now re-create the appropriate colorMap (which
here depends on additional parameters), but a convenience function
"QwtScaleWidget::setColorBarInterval" seems more appropriate.

This patch adds this convenience function.
