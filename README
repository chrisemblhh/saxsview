libsaxsdocument and saxsview
============================

Read, convert and view files related to Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS).

The libraries, libsaxsdocument and libsaxsview, are released under the LGPLv3,
saxsview under the GPLv3. See the respective COPYING-files for details.

In the initial proof-of-concept implementation, file formats of the ATSAS
programs are implemented. However, the scope of libsaxsdocument is to integrate
as many formats as are being used in SAXS. Collaborations and contribution of
reading/writing code would be highly welcome!

The saxsview application requires Qt-4.4 or later and Qwt (qwt.sourceforge.net),
the latter is included in this repository to allow for local modifications. The
build system is CMake (www.cmake.org), version 2.6.x should work. To compile
the Fortran bindings for libsaxsdocument, gcc-4.3 or later will be necessary.
Without these, an earlier version should be fine.

The code is plain C for libsaxsdocument and based on Qt/Qwt for saxsview. It
should be possible to compile it on any recent Linux, Windows or Mac platform.
I'd consider it a bug otherwise.

To build (bash):
    $> mkdir build; cd build
    $> cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[install-path]
    $> make all test
    $> make install
