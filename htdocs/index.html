<h1><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxsview/">saxsview</a></h1>
<p><i>libsaxsdocument</i> and <i>saxsview</i>; read, convert and view
1D and 2D-files related to Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS).</p>


<h2>saxsview</h2>
<p><i>saxsview</i> is intended as an day-to-day plotting facility for SAXS-data,
as well as a convenient tool to quickly generate plots ready for publication.</p>

<p>Basic plotting of 1D-curves is available (.dat, .int, .fit/.fir formats of the
 <a href="http://www.embl-hamburg.de/ExternalInfo/Research/Sax/software.html">ATSAS
package</a>), so is the display of 2D scattering images in Crystallographic Binary
Format (CBF, using <a href="http://www.bernstein-plus-sons.com/software/CBF/">CBFlib</a>).</p>

<p>The program is based on <a href="http://qt.nokia.com/">Qt - A cross-platform
application and UI framework</a> and <a href="http://qwt.sourceforge.net">Qwt - Qt Plotting
Widgets for Technical Applications</a>.</p>

<p>As is, it was successfully compiled and used on Linux (i686-pc-linux-gnu) and
Windows (i686-unknown-mingw), it is to expect that it works on Mac as well.</p>


<h2>libsaxsdocument</h2>
<p><i>libsaxsdocument</i> is the reading and writing workhorse of saxsview. It meant
to allow for easy integration of new 1D and 2D-file formats. Further, if formats that
hold similar information implement reading and writing hooks, it becomes very easy
to convert between these respective formats. Eventually simplifying data-transfer
between programs.</p>

<p>For later releases, support for TIFF32 (as written by PILATUS detectors) and 
the MAR345 file formats are planned.</p>


<h2>Releases</h2>
<ul>
  <li>2009/08/24 - <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxsview/files/">saxsview-0.1.0</a> was released
</ul>

<p>Suggestions, bug reports and code contributions are highly welcome!</p>
